      content="It's critical for colleges and universities to create seamless pathways for their students to find the programs and services that are right for them. Folks have to see that you have what they want, and then they need an easy pathway to get to it. Dynamic, personalized content can enable you to keep a streamlined design while bringing the information that is directly relevant to the specific website visitor to the forefront."
